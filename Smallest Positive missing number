You are given an array arr[] of N integers. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Note: Positive number starts from 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 6
Explanation: Smallest positive missing 
number is 6.



def findSmallestMissing(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Create a boolean array of size N+1
    present = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    # Mark the positions of elements that are within the range of 1 to N
    for i in range(n):
        if 1 <= arr[i] <= n:
            present[arr[i]] = True
    
    # Find the first index where the value is false
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not present[i]:
            return i
    
    # If all elements are in the range 1 to N, the smallest missing number is N+1
    return n + 1

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = findSmallestMissing(arr)
print("Smallest positive missing number is", result)
